# “Introduction to Data Science Methodology using a case study: Cuisine Prediction using Ingredients”  

This file provides a walkthrough following the steps involved in Data Science Methodology, CRISP-DM and solves the problem of predicting the cuisine from the list of given ingredients.  

The raw data available is in the json format. For the extraction of the data in the required format ready for analysis, I have provided the “Extraction from .json to .csv” that can be found in the same repository.  

Once the .csv are prepared, one can follow through the “Data Science Methodology along with Cuisine Prediction.ipynb”.
Everyone is most welcome for their reviews and suggestions.
